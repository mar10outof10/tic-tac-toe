# TIC TAC TOE game 

## Stack: JS/CSS/HTML

Blue goes first.

Click the board on an empty space to play that space.

First colour to get three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally win.

If the board fills up without a winning combo, the game ends in a draw.

Have fun!

### Random Mode
If this mode is turned on, the game will generate a Blue and Yellow play on a random playable cell every time the board is clicked/tapped. The rest of the rules of the game remain the same. 

### Accessibility
Allow players to play just by using a keyboard as their only input.
